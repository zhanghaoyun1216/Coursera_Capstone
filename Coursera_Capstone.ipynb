With a population of nearly 8.8 million people, diverse range of culture and one of the most popular airports in the world, the city is a bastion of cultural and culinary diversity.\n- **Business problem:**\n\nThis project is relevant to those who are interested in opening a restaurant in London and mainly provides information on one of the dimensions - location of the comprehensive task. We seek to find an optimal location to open a new restaurant."

In this project, we seek to find **desirable locations belonging to different boroughs** based on the consideration of the diverse backgrounds of stakeholder and the complexity of London. "
